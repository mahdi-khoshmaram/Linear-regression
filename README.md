- In this repository I tried to implement every single function that we use in scikit learn for linear regression.
- I created two very small dataset, one with 1 feature(x1) and the other with 3 featurs(x3).
- Also functions have been written in two methods; 1- with vectorization(_vec) 2-without vectorization using for loops(_unvec).  Hence every single function implemented twice.
- At the end, I compare the results of my functions with scikit learn's results.
